In this lab, I learned how to write C programs and follow the instructions, word for word, to achieve the desired result.

I made mistakes, such as forgetting to put the BOARD.c and BOARD.h in the right folder.  I identified it by going to the TA meeting and he helped me find the build error.

I wish the lab would be more descriptive and shorter because it's a lot of instructions for just 1 lab.
